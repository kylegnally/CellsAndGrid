        // Somewhere in this class you will want to write code that will implement the GenericQueue 
        // class to create a linked list of segments that will allow each segment to "follow" the
        // one before it. The data in each node will be a two-dimensional array containing the
        // coordinates for each segment and these coordinates will update with each press of the arrow 
        // key. On redraw, this will give the appearance that the snake is moving along the path
        // defined by the user.
        //
        // The added benefit of using the GenericQueue is that once the Nutrition property of the Apple
        // class is implemented in the Drawgrid() method of Grid it should be relatively easy to increase the 
        // length of the snake. This will also allow for special Apples that have a higher Nutrition
        // than others. However, you should bear in mind that you will need to read the queue holding
        // the snake to learn the coordinates of each of its segments on the grid before using it in
        // Drawgrid(). 
        //
        // There's an obvious way to do this and a not-so-obvious way. The obvious way is to simply store
        // the coordinates as a [,] in each entry in the queue and read them directly, drawing as needed.
        // Since we're already using [,] arrays throughout the Grid class we already have practice doing 
        // this. The not-so-obvious way is to entirely dispense with the use of coordinates and simply
        // store the user's directional keystrokes. The advantage there is that it eliminates the 
        // possibility of getting the coordinate determination algorithm wrong (because that wouldn't 
        // be necessary). Since programmers (+me) are lazy the keystroke method is the path of least
        // resistance.
